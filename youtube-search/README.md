`Youtube Search` will be deployed to `Heroku` and will allow users to search and watch videos from Youtube through Google's `YouTube Data API v3`.

`Books` is just a basic primer on storing and retrieving data from Redux from withing the React application.

`Weather` is a fully functional app (will be deployed to `Heroku`) for searching and viewing weather forecast for any number of US cities. It uses all the goodness from Redux to React to React router to 3rd party APIs.
